# TunnelFunctionalDesign
Code used for the hydraulic design of a cavitation tunnel, currently installed at the Technical University of Delft.


This code can be modified and used for the hydraulic design and turbulence management section (contraction, honeycomb, settling chamber) design for any wind/water tunnel. For wind-tunnel, you need to add mesh elements which is typically avoided in high-speed water tunnel facilities, like those funded by the military for full scale testing.
